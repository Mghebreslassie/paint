the painting canvas was built on top of built-in canvas api using a library called fabric js. clicking on the rectangle, triangle or circle will drop a default shape on to the canvas. Their are properties like skew and stroke width that can be adjusted for shapes, but are not available for other tools. At the bottom of the page is links to our githubs.
